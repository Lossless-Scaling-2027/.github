# Lossless Scaling

**All-in-one gaming utility for scaling and frame generation**

## What is Lossless Scaling?

Lossless Scaling allows you to scale windowed games to full screen using the state-of-the-art scaling algorithms, as well as use ML-based proprietary scaling and frame generation.

### Frame generation options:
- LSFG

### Scaling options:
- LS1  
- AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution  
- NVIDIA Image Scaling  
- Integer Scaling  
- Nearest Neighbor  
- xBR  
- Anime4K  
- Sharp Bilinear  
- Bicubic CAS  

The latest feature allows you to use Lossless Scaling to generate additional frames in games that do not have such support, including emulators.

Lossless Scaling is also useful for:
- Upscaling modern games if you cannot run them at native screen resolution (GPU limited) and want to get rid of blur due to bilinear scaling of the GPU driver.
- Upscaling older and pixel-art games which do not support modern screen resolutions or full screen mode.

### Recommended Use Cases:
- **Modern games**: Use **LS1** or **AMD FSR**  
- **Pixel-art games**: Use **Integer Scaling** or **xBR**  
- **Cartoons/Anime**: Use **Anime4K**
